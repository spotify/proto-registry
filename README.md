# Schema Registry

This is an implementation of a Protobuf schema registry.  Right now, the implementation is fairly
basic and focuses on the documentation aspects of a registry.

## Development

Right now, the building process is a bit hacky.  It assumes that there is a file in
`src/schema/schema.pb` containing a `FileDescriptorSet` containing the schema to be browsed.  This
file can be generated by the `./build-index` script at the root of the repository (connected via a
symbolic link).

After that, simply run the usual:

    yarn
    yarn start

## Design considerations

The registry responds to resources at `/<type name>` only.  This matches the API of the
[`Any`][Any] type (even though the registry currently doesn't respond with a [`Type`][Type] object
if requested).  The idea is that the registry should respond with documentation when requested (e.g.
when the request specifies `Accept: text/html` or similar) and with a [`Type`][Type] otherwise.
